this is the documentation for me working on fourier series


basically found a audio file of a song that I liked

converted it into .wav file

cut the wave file into a segment that I wanted to hear

do fft on the segment to get a list of combinations of freqs and amplitudes

Since the range is all the frequencies of human hearing, we have to cut it down to fit it into midi.

Need map each freq to a note, and need to cut off the lower and highest freqs since dont want highest and lowest notes on midi to be overplayed.

perhaps we can split the keyboard in half so that we can get for right and for left hand
